The inventory survey report recommends that ${4:data recovery be carried
out near the two trenches where pit features were found associated
with the charcoal-darkened sand}
\\citep{${5:bassford07:_archaeol_inven_survey_of}}.  The SHPD concurred with
the recommendation to conduct data recovery in its review letter
accepting the inventory survey report (LOG NO: ${6:2007:2760}).
Accordingly, this data recovery plan has been prepared by a
fully-qualified archaeologist pursuant to Hawai`\i Administrative
\\textit{Rules Governing Standards for Archaeological Data Recovery
  Studies and Reports}, \\S13--278--3.
