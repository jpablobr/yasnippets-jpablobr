\\opening{Dear ${2:$$(yas/choose-value '("Mr. Oringer" "Ms. Ford"))}:}

% At the request of \\client, \\tsdye\\ is
% providing information to determine if the proposed collocation of the
% \\project\\ will require a National Historic Preservation Act Section
% 106 review. The Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the
% Collocation of Wireless Antennas on Buildings and Non-Tower Structures
% Outside of Historic Districts (NPA) was utilized in evaluating the project.
% OR
At the request of \\client, \\tsdye\\ is
providing information to address the Federal Communications Commission
National Environmental Policy Act compliance evaluation based on
Stipulation V.A.1-4 of the Nationwide Programmatic Agreement for the
Collocation of Wireless Antennas on a Building or Non-Tower Structure
Outside of an Historic District (NPA).

\\tsdye\\ was requested to address Stipulations V.A.1 and V.A.2 of the NPA.
Stipulations V.A.1 and V.A.2 state:

\\begin{compactenum}[A.]
\\item An antenna may be mounted on a building or non-tower structure
without such collocation being reviewed under the consultation process
set forth under Subpart B of 36 CFR Part 800, unless:
\\begin{compactenum}[1]
\\item  The building or structure is over 45 years old; or % \\footnote{Suitable
% methods for determining the age of a building include, but are not
% limited to: (1) obtaining the opinion of a consultant who meets the
% Secretary of Interiorâ€™s Professional Qualifications Standards (36 CFR
% Part 61) or (2) consulting public records.}

%   \\item The building or structure is inside the boundary of a historic
%   district, or if the antenna is visible from the ground level of the
%   historic district, the building or structure is within 250 feet of
%   the boundary of the historic district.

\\item The building or other non-tower structure on which the antenna
  is to be mounted is located \\begin{inparaenum}[(a)]\\item inside the
    boundary of a historic district, or \\item outside, but within
    250~ft.\\ of the boundary of a historic district, and the antenna
    is visible from ground level anywhere within the historic
    district.
  \\end{inparaenum}

% \\item The building or non-tower structure is a designated National
%   Historic Landmark, or listed in or eligible for listing in the
%   National Register of Historic Places based upon the review of the
%   licensee, tower company or applicant for an antenna license; or
% \\item The collocation licensee or the owner
%   of the tower has received written or electronic notification that
%   the FCC is in receipt of a complaint from a member of the public, a
%   SHPO or the Council, that the collocation has an adverse effect on
%   one or more historic properties. Any such complaint must be in
%   writing and supported by substantial evidence describing how the
%   effect from the collocation is adverse to the attributes that
%   qualify any affected historic property for eligibility or potential
%   eligibility for the National Register.
\\end{compactenum}
% B. Subsequent to the collocation of an antenna, should the SHPO/THPO
% or Council determine that the collocation of the antenna or its
% associated equipment installed under the terms of Stipulation V has
% resulted in an adverse effect on historic properties, the SHPO/THPO or
% Council may notify the FCC accordingly. The FCC shall comply with the
% requirements of Section 106 and 36 CFR Part 800 for this particular
% collocation.
